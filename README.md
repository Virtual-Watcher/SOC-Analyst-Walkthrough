# Walkthrough of "So you want to be a SOC Analyst?"

### Introduction
In my personal journey of learning more to get into the field of Cybersecurity, I came across Eric Capuano's blog, "So you want to be a SOC Analyst?". To showcase my personal experience with this hands-on training series, I will document my journey step-by-step as I follow along and have it broken down into parts that are beginner friendly, where the relevant blog post will be posted at the top of the walkthrough so you can choose either to practice with at your convienience. 

At many times there will be overlap between my walkthrough and the blog as this series is to reflect my personal experience following along, but also to educate and help those looking for more visuals as I cover parts in-between steps or have to alter certain exercises to work for myself. 

I highly suggest you check out the blog as it is greatly educational!
